    <h1>Privacy Policy for Jeda</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> March 3, 2025</p>

    <p>Thank you for using <strong>Jeda</strong>, the holiday calendar app designed to help you plan and manage your holidays efficiently. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to being transparent about how we handle your information.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Jeda <strong>does not collect, store, or share any personal or non-personal information</strong> from its users. The app operates entirely on your device, and no data is transmitted to us or any third parties.</p>

    <h2>2. Notification Permissions</h2>
    <p>Jeda may request permission to send <strong>notifications</strong> to your device. This permission is used solely to provide you with reminders and updates about holidays or events you have set in the app. Notifications are enabled only if you explicitly choose to allow them, and you can disable them at any time through your device settings.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Jeda does not integrate with any third-party services that collect user data. The app is designed to function independently without relying on external data collection or processing.</p>

    <h2>4. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Jeda is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any data, there is no risk of unintentional data collection from children.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we will notify you through the app or via email. Your continued use of Jeda after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
